    About us:
    Warby Parker was founded in 2010 with a lofty objective: to offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price while leading the way for socially conscious businesses. By circumventing traditional channels and designing our frames in house, we're able to offer insanely high-quality eyewear at decidedly non-insane prices (i.e., from $95 with prescription lenses—a fraction of the going price!). 
    
    In the last eight years, we've grown to over 60 retail locations in the U.S. and Canada, opened our first optical lab in upstate New York, and launched two of our own iOS apps. And for three years running, Fast Company has named us one of the world's most innovative companies. 
    
    We also hold ourselves to the highest standards of social and environmental responsibility. This means lots of different things, like operating carbon-neutrally and distributing a pair of glasses to someone in need for every pair we sell. (We're big believers that businesses can scale and be profitable while doing good in the world.) 
    
    Of course, all work and no play makes an extremely dull office, and no one likes an extremely dull office. (We sure don't.) As an employee at Warby Parker, you can look forward to company outings, guest speakers, volunteering opportunities, and other brain- (and/or taste-bud-) stimulating activities. It also doesn't hurt that our team is just great company. 
    
    Some benefits and perks of working at Warby Parker:
    Health, vision, and dental insurance
    Flexible My-Time vacation policy
    Retirement savings plan with a company match
    Parental leave (non-birthing parents included)
    Cell phone plan reimbursement
    A health-and-wellness stipend
    Free eyewear (plus discounts for friends and family)
    And more (just ask!)",
